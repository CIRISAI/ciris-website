"""The CIRIS glossaries: canonical terminology, per language, as pipeline input.

29 files at ``localization/glossaries/{code}_glossary.md`` — 28 languages plus
``TEMPLATE``. Each is a set of markdown tables whose first column is English
and whose second is the target language, followed (in 24 of them) by a
``## Cultural Considerations`` block of prose that is worth more than the
tables: it is where "address users with the formal እርስዎ, not አንተ/አንቺ" lives,
and that is the kind of thing a translator gets wrong once and a glossary
prevents forever.

WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT A PROMPT STRING. Glossary-first is the one
practice CIRISAgent's LESSONS_LEARNED.md credits unreservedly: terminology is
frozen BEFORE translation so ACCORD, the guide, the UI strings and the DMA
prompts cannot disagree about what "Wise Authority" is. Injecting the glossary
into every request is how a pipeline keeps that promise without a human in the
loop, and injecting only the RELEVANT terms is how it keeps doing so without
spending the context window on 3,045 pairs.
