"""Translate, evaluate and repair CIRIS localization keys — one pipeline, in CI.

    python3 localization/localize.py --check                     # what is missing
    python3 localization/localize.py --lane translate            # missing keys -> 28 locales
    python3 localization/localize.py --lane translate --keys 'mesh_config.*'
    python3 localization/localize.py --lane evaluate --keys 'commons_surface.*'
    python3 localization/localize.py --lane repair   --keys 'nav.*' --lang yo

THREE LANES, ONE DIRECTION. `--lane` chooses where a run ENTERS; every run then
flows through the rest:

    translate ──► evaluate ──► repair
                  ▲             ▲
                  └─ enter here └─ enter here

A key brought in to be translated is reviewed before it is written, and
repaired if the review found anything. A review that finds nothing makes repair
a no-op — it is not skipped, it has nothing to do. There is no lane that writes
an unreviewed string into a shipped bundle.

WHY A PIPELINE AND NOT AN AGENT FAN-OUT. This replaces the interactive Claude
Code fan-outs (CIRISServer 0.5.185's 87 agents). Same model family, ~100x
cheaper, and — the part that matters more — reproducible: the same keys, the
same glossary, the same anchors, the same gate. `check_localization_sync.py
--strict` decides what merges either way.

The fan-out also failed in a way this design has to answer for. Haiku sub-agents
were the documented recommendation (CIRISAgent LESSONS_LEARNED.md §3) and they
produced word-salad in 5 of 28 locales that STRUCTURAL validation could not
see: the JSON parsed, the keys were all present, the placeholders matched.
Nothing below the semantic layer can catch that, which is why the evaluate lane
exists and why it is not optional.

── The four inputs every request carries ──────────────────────────────────────

1. GLOSSARY — `localization/glossaries/{code}_glossary.md`, 3,045 canonical term
   pairs across 28 languages, plus each language's standing prose rules (use the
   formal እርስዎ; never omit Yoruba's dot-below). Only the terms that occur in the
   batch are sent. Glossary-first is the one practice the retrospectives credit
   unreservedly.
2. TRANSLATION MEMORY — real shipped translations for this language, retrieved
   two ways: the dot-prefix family of each requested key, and lexical overlap
   with its English text. ~3,853 keys x 29 locales already exist; a model asked
   to translate "node" fresh will pick something, and the corpus already
   decided. Adaptive MT with fuzzy matches is the standard construction here
   (Moslem et al., EAMT 2023).
3. THE ENGLISH SOURCE — byte-identical across all 28 language requests, so it
   sits in one cacheable prefix.
4. THE PLACEHOLDER CONTRACT — stated, then enforced mechanically afterwards.

── Evaluate: MQM, not a vibe ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

The review lane asks for error SPANS with a category and a severity, following
MQM as GEMBA-MQM applies it to LLM judging: reference-free, span-level,
`{accuracy, fluency, terminology, style, locale}` x `{critical, major, minor}`,
scored by severity weight. A number with no error list behind it is a number
nobody can act on, so the lane emits the errors and derives the score.

The judge is a DIFFERENT MODEL FAMILY from the drafter, on purpose. A judge
that shares the drafter's weights shares its blind spots and prefers its own
output; independence is the whole value of the second pass.

── No rejections, and what that costs ─────────────────────────────────────────

Low-resource languages are where this gets decided. Yoruba, Hausa and Amharic
are Tier 0 in CIRIS's own priority order — ranked by INVERSE model support,
because Meta-Goal M-1 makes need the criterion rather than market size — and
they are exactly where a model is most likely to say it cannot help.

A refusal is therefore made EXPRESSIBLE so it can be detected (the model is
asked to return `null` and a reason rather than inventing something), and then
it is never accepted as an answer. The key escalates to the next rung of the
ladder — one key, not the batch — and the ladder's last rung is a different
model family from the first. If every rung refuses, the run FAILS LOUDLY. It
does not fall back to English: shipping English to a Yoruba speaker under a
Yoruba locale is the silent demotion this whole apparatus exists to prevent.

Escalation is per key and per language, so the cost of the hard cases is paid
on the hard cases.

── What this pipeline does NOT claim ──────────────────────────────────────────

CIRISAgent's `localization/CLAUDE.md` is blunt about the line, and this tool
holds it. GUARANTEED: terminology consistency, structural completeness,
functional correctness, meaning preservation, placeholder integrity. NOT
guaranteed: native fluency, dialect coverage, cultural adaptation of metaphor,
legal review. Everything this pipeline writes is `status: draft` /
`review_status: needs_native_review` until a speaker signs off, and no output
of it may be marketed as native quality.

── Cost design, in the order that actually saves money ────────────────────────

1. DIFF-DRIVEN by default — a run with nothing missing makes zero API calls,
   which is also the workflow's loop guard.
2. SHARED CACHEABLE PREFIX — system + English source are byte-identical across
   the 28 language requests.
3. RELEVANT glossary and anchors only — not 3,045 pairs.
4. ESCALATION IS SPARING — the expensive rungs see only what the cheap rung
   refused or the judge rejected.
5. BATCH MODE — the same requests at 50% off for backfills nobody is waiting on.

Providers: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` drives the OpenRouter path (the ladder's model
ids are OpenRouter slugs; `:batch` halves them). `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` drives the
Anthropic SDK path, which adds real prompt caching and the Batches API but can
only reach Anthropic rungs. `LOCALIZE_PROVIDER=anthropic|openrouter` forces one.
