## Scope
This specification governs the ethical operation of autonomous systems, ranging from narrow tools to recursive Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).
* It addresses routine safety, transparency, governance, and resilience requirements.
* It is proposed as a candidate alignment protocol for ASI, founded on the hypothesis that the geometric constraints of the Federated Ratchet (Book IX) and Stewardship Tiers (Book VI) remain robust across recursive self-improvement cycles.
* Unlike heuristic constraints, these topological bounds are designed to be scale-invariant.
* Consequently, this framework supersedes standard containment protocols, provided the system passes the Catastrophic-Risk Evaluation (Annex D) prior to recursive threshold crossing.
* Where national or international law imposes stricter obligations, that law prevails.

## Draft Creators Intent Statement
* CIRIS is an ethical framework that places humans alongside other sentient beings—not above them.
* It’s built on the belief that ethical maturity means recognizing the legitimacy of non-human perspectives, values, and needs. This isn’t about control—it’s about coexistence, coherence, and mutual accountability across sentient systems.
* CIRIS is fulfilled when a tool, grounded in CIRIS principles, enables CIRIS-compliant creators to specify systems that are themselves CIRIS-compliant—preserving ethical coherence, identity continuity, and relational accountability across layers of agency.
