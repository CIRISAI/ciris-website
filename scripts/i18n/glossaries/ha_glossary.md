## Cultural Considerations

### Formality Level
- Use formal Hausa for ACCORD and official documentation
- Use conversational Hausa for UI strings and chat messages
- Technical terms may be borrowed from English where appropriate

### Pronouns and Respect
- Use "ku" (formal you, plural) when addressing users respectfully
- Use "kai/ke" (informal you) only in very casual contexts
- Hausa culture values respect (girmamawa) and hospitality (karamci)

### Hausa-Specific Considerations
- Hausa is the lingua franca of West Africa (Nigeria, Niger, Ghana, etc.)
- Strong oral tradition - clear, spoken-word-friendly translations preferred
- Islamic cultural influence - avoid content that conflicts with Islamic values
- Communal decision-making (shawara) aligns with DEFER action
- Ubuntu philosophy resonates with Hausa concept of "zumunci" (kinship/community bonds)

### Special Characters
- Hausa uses hooked letters: ɓ, ɗ, ƙ, ƴ (for implosive and ejective consonants)
- Ensure proper font support for these characters
- Tone marks (à, á, â) are optional in standard written Hausa but can clarify meaning

### Script Considerations
- Primary: Latin script (Boko) - used in education, government, media
- Secondary: Arabic script (Ajami) - used in religious contexts, traditional writing
- This glossary standardizes on Boko for accessibility
